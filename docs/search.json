    "text": "Experimental Results\n\nCharitable Contribution Made\nFirst, I analyze whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation.\ntodo: make a barplot with two bars. Each bar is the proportion of people who donated. One bar for treatment and one bar for control.\ntodo: run a t-test between the treatment and control groups on the binary outcome of whether any charitable donation was made. Also run a bivariate linear regression that demonstrates the same finding. (It may help to confirm your calculations match Table 2a Panel A.) Report your statistical results and interpret them in the context of the experiment (e.g., if you found a difference with a small p-value or that was statistically significant at some threshold, what have you learned about human behavior? Use mostly English words, not numbers or stats, to explain your finding.)\ntodo: run a probit regression where the outcome variable is whether any charitable donation was made and the explanatory variable is assignment to treatment or control. Confirm that your results replicate Table 3 column 1 in the paper.\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\ntodo: Use a series of t-tests to test whether the size of the match ratio has an effect on whether people donate or not. For example, does the 2:1 match rate lead increase the likelihood that someone donates as compared to the 1:1 match rate? Do your results support the “figures suggest” comment the authors make on page 8?\ntodo: Assess the same issue using a regression. Specifically, create the variable ratio1 then regress gave on ratio1, ratio2, and ratio3 (or alternatively, regress gave on the categorical variable ratio). Interpret the coefficients and their statistical precision.\ntodo: Calculate the response rate difference between the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratios and the 2:1 and 3:1 ratios. Do this directly from the data, and do it by computing the differences in the fitted coefficients of the previous regression. what do you conclude regarding the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations?\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\ntodo: Calculate a t-test or run a bivariate linear regression of the donation amount on the treatment status. What do we learn from doing this analysis?\ntodo: now limit the data to just people who made a donation and repeat the previous analysis. This regression allows you to analyze how much respondents donate conditional on donating some positive amount. Interpret the regression coefficients – what did we learn? Does the treatment coefficient have a causal interpretation?\ntodo: Make two plot: one for the treatment group and one for the control. Each plot should be a histogram of the donation amounts only among people who donated. Add a red vertical bar or some other annotation to indicate the sample average for each plot."

To do this, you will simulate 100,00 draws from the control distribution and 10,000 draws from the treatment distribution. You’ll then calculate a vector of 10,000 differences, and then you’ll plot the cumulative average of that vector of differences. Comment on whether the cumulative average approaches the true difference in means.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\nto do: Make 4 histograms like those on slide 44 from our first class at sample sizes 50, 200, 500, and 1000 and explain these plots to the reader. To do this for a sample size of e.g. 50, take 50 draws from each of the control and treatment distributions, and calculate the average difference between those draws. Then repeat that process 999 more times so that you have 1000 averages. Plot the histogram of those averages. Comment on whether zero is in the “middle” of the distribution or whether it’s in the “tail.”"

The matching grant effectively multiplies the impact of their donation, which appears to be a compelling incentive. ### Differences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\n\n# Compare effectiveness of different match ratios (1:1, 2:1, 3:1) on donation rates\ntreat_df = df[df[\"treatment\"] == 1].copy()\n\nfor col in [\"ratio\", \"ratio2\", \"ratio3\"]:\n    treat_df[col] = pd.to_numeric(treat_df[col], errors='coerce').fillna(0).astype(int)\n\ntreat_df[\"ratio1\"] = treat_df[\"ratio\"]\n\nratio_rates = treat_df.groupby([\"ratio1\", \"ratio2\", \"ratio3\"])[\"gave\"].mean()\nprint(\"Donation rates by match ratio:\")\nprint(ratio_rates)\n\ngroup_1_1 = treat_df[treat_df[\"ratio1\"] == 1][\"gave\"]\ngroup_2_1 = treat_df[treat_df[\"ratio2\"] == 1][\"gave\"]\nt_2, p_2 = stats.ttest_ind(group_2_1, group_1_1)\nprint(\"\\n2:1 vs 1:1 match rate:\")\nprint(f\"t-statistic: {t_2:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"p-value: {p_2:.4f}\")\n\ngroup_3_1 = treat_df[treat_df[\"ratio3\"] == 1][\"gave\"]\nt_3, p_3 = stats.ttest_ind(group_3_1, group_1_1)\nprint(\"\\n3:1 vs 1:1 match rate:\")\nprint(f\"t-statistic: {t_3:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"p-value: {p_3:.4f}\")\n\nmodel_ratio = smf.ols(\"gave ~ ratio1 + ratio2 + ratio3\", data=treat_df).fit()\nprint(\"\\nRegression on match ratios:\")\nprint(model_ratio.summary().tables[1])\n\nresponse_1_1 = treat_df[treat_df[\"ratio1\"] == 1][\"gave\"].mean()\nresponse_2_1 = treat_df[treat_df[\"ratio2\"] == 1][\"gave\"].mean()\nresponse_3_1 = treat_df[treat_df[\"ratio3\"] == 1][\"gave\"].mean()\n\ndiff_2v1 = response_2_1 - response_1_1\ndiff_3v2 = response_3_1 - response_2_1\n\nprint(\"\\nResponse rate differences:\")\nprint(f\"2:1 vs 1:1: {diff_2v1:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"3:1 vs 2:1: {diff_3v2:.4f}\")\n\nratio_data = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Match Ratio': ['1:1', '2:1', '3:1'],\n    'Donation Rate': [response_1_1, response_2_1, response_3_1]\n})\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nax = sns.barplot(x='Match Ratio', y='Donation Rate', data=ratio_data, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Donation Rate by Match Ratio', fontsize=14)\nplt.ylabel('Proportion Donated', fontsize=12)\n\nfor i, v in enumerate(ratio_data['Donation Rate']):\n    ax.text(i, v + 0.001, f\"{v:.3f}\", ha='center', fontsize=11)\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\nDonation rates by match ratio:\nratio1  ratio2  ratio3\n1       0       0         0.020749\n2       1       0         0.022633\n3       0       1         0.022733\nName: gave, dtype: float64\n\n2:1 vs 1:1 match rate:\nt-statistic: 0.9650\np-value: 0.3345\n\n3:1 vs 1:1 match rate:\nt-statistic: 1.0150\np-value: 0.3101\n\nRegression on match ratios:\n==============================================================================\n                 coef    std err          t      P&gt;|t|      [0.025      0.975]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIntercept    3.03e+09   1.66e+10      0.183      0.855   -2.95e+10    3.55e+10\nratio1      -3.03e+09   1.66e+10     -0.183      0.855   -3.55e+10    2.95e+10\nratio2       3.03e+09   1.66e+10      0.183      0.855   -2.95e+10    3.55e+10\nratio3       6.06e+09   3.31e+10      0.183      0.855   -5.89e+10     7.1e+10\n==============================================================================\n\nResponse rate differences:\n2:1 vs 1:1: 0.0019\n3:1 vs 2:1: 0.0001\n\n\nC:\\Users\\timon\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ipykernel_24648\\474621105.py:47: FutureWarning:\n\n\n\nPassing `palette` without assigning `hue` is deprecated and will be removed in v0.14.0. Assign the `x` variable to `hue` and set `legend=False` for the same effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results show that there is no statistically significant difference in donation rates between the different match ratios (1:1, 2:1, and 3:1). This is consistent with what Karlan and List suggest in their paper.\nFrom a behavioral perspective, this is an interesting finding. It suggests that while the presence of a match offer itself increases giving, the size of the match offer does not have a significant additional effect. This highlights that what matters most is the perception of support or urgency created by the match, not necessarily the financial efficiency of the match.\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\n\n# Analyzing the impact of matching grants on donation amounts and visualize distributions\namount_control = df[df[\"treatment\"] == 0][\"amount\"]\namount_treatment = df[df[\"treatment\"] == 1][\"amount\"]\nt_stat_amt, p_val_amt = stats.ttest_ind(amount_treatment, amount_control)\n\nprint(\"T-test on donation amount:\")\nprint(f\"t-statistic: {t_stat_amt:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"p-value: {p_val_amt:.4f}\")\n\nmodel_amt = smf.ols(\"amount ~ treatment\", data=df).fit()\nprint(\"\\nRegression on donation amount:\")\nprint(model_amt.summary().tables[1])\n\ndf_gave = df[df[\"gave\"] == 1].copy()\n\nmodel_cond = smf.ols(\"amount ~ treatment\", data=df_gave).fit()\nprint(\"\\nRegression on donation amount (only for donors):\")\nprint(model_cond.summary().tables[1])\n\nmean_treat = df_gave[df_gave[\"treatment\"] == 1][\"amount\"].mean()\nmean_control = df_gave[df_gave[\"treatment\"] == 0][\"amount\"].mean()\n\nprint(f\"\\nMean donation amount (treatment): ${mean_treat:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Mean donation amount (control): ${mean_control:.2f}\")\n\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(14, 6), sharey=True)\n\ntreat_donors = df_gave[df_gave[\"treatment\"] == 1][\"amount\"]\naxs[0].hist(treat_donors, bins=30, color='blue', edgecolor='black', alpha=0.7)\naxs[0].axvline(mean_treat, color='red', linestyle='dashed', linewidth=2)\naxs[0].set_title(\"Treatment Group\", fontsize=14)\naxs[0].set_xlabel(\"Donation Amount ($)\", fontsize=12)\naxs[0].set_ylabel(\"Frequency\", fontsize=12)\n\ncontrol_donors = df_gave[df_gave[\"treatment\"] == 0][\"amount\"]\naxs[1].hist(control_donors, bins=30, color='green', edgecolor='black', alpha=0.7)\naxs[1].axvline(mean_control, color='red', linestyle='dashed', linewidth=2)\naxs[1].set_title(\"Control Group\", fontsize=14)\naxs[1].set_xlabel(\"Donation Amount ($)\", fontsize=12)\n\nplt.suptitle(\"Distribution of Donation Amounts (Donors Only)\", fontsize=16, y=1.05)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\nT-test on donation amount:\nt-statistic: 1.8605\np-value: 0.0628\n\nRegression on donation amount:\n==============================================================================\n                 coef    std err          t      P&gt;|t|      [0.025      0.975]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIntercept      0.8133      0.067     12.063      0.000       0.681       0.945\ntreatment      0.1536      0.083      1.861      0.063      -0.008       0.315\n==============================================================================\n\nRegression on donation amount (only for donors):\n==============================================================================\n                 coef    std err          t      P&gt;|t|      [0.025      0.975]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIntercept     45.5403      2.423     18.792      0.000      40.785      50.296\ntreatment     -1.6684      2.872     -0.581      0.561      -7.305       3.968\n==============================================================================\n\nMean donation amount (treatment): $43.87\nMean donation amount (control): $45.54\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe analysis of donation amounts reveals that the treatment group has a lower average donation amount compared to the control group. When considering all potential donors (including non-donors, same as only looking at donors), the treatment effect is negative but not statistically significant.\nThis indicates that the matching grant primarily works by motivating more people to donate rather than by encouraging substantially larger donations from those who would have given anyway."

Each bar is the proportion of people who donated. One bar for treatment and one bar for control.\ntodo: run a t-test between the treatment and control groups on the binary outcome of whether any charitable donation was made. Also run a bivariate linear regression that demonstrates the same finding. (It may help to confirm your calculations match Table 2a Panel A.) Report your statistical results and interpret them in the context of the experiment (e.g., if you found a difference with a small p-value or that was statistically significant at some threshold, what have you learned about human behavior? Use mostly English words, not numbers or stats, to explain your finding.)\ntodo: run a probit regression where the outcome variable is whether any charitable donation was made and the explanatory variable is assignment to treatment or control. Confirm that your results replicate Table 3 column 1 in the paper.\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\ntodo: Use a series of t-tests to test whether the size of the match ratio has an effect on whether people donate or not. For example, does the 2:1 match rate lead increase the likelihood that someone donates as compared to the 1:1 match rate? Do your results support the “figures suggest” comment the authors make on page 8?\ntodo: Assess the same issue using a regression. Specifically, create the variable ratio1 then regress gave on ratio1, ratio2, and ratio3 (or alternatively, regress gave on the categorical variable ratio). Interpret the coefficients and their statistical precision.\ntodo: Calculate the response rate difference between the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratios and the 2:1 and 3:1 ratios. Do this directly from the data, and do it by computing the differences in the fitted coefficients of the previous regression. what do you conclude regarding the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations?\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\ntodo: Calculate a t-test or run a bivariate linear regression of the donation amount on the treatment status. What do we learn from doing this analysis?\ntodo: now limit the data to just people who made a donation and repeat the previous analysis. This regression allows you to analyze how much respondents donate conditional on donating some positive amount. Interpret the regression coefficients – what did we learn? Does the treatment coefficient have a causal interpretation?\ntodo: Make two plot: one for the treatment group and one for the control. Each plot should be a histogram of the donation amounts only among people who donated. Add a red vertical bar or some other annotation to indicate the sample average for each plot."

Comment on whether zero is in the “middle” of the distribution or whether it’s in the “tail.”\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n\ndf.info()\ndf.head()\nprint(df.columns)\n\n\n## Balance Test\nprint(\"Balance Test\")\n\n# Mean donation rates and amounts by treatment group\ndf.groupby(\"treatment\")[[\"gave\", \"amount\"]].mean()\n\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n\n# Linear probability model\nmodel_gave = smf.ols(\"gave ~ treatment\", data=df).fit()\nprint(model_gave.summary())\n\n\n# OLS on amount donated\nmodel_amt = smf.ols(\"amount ~ treatment\", data=df).fit()\nprint(model_amt.summary())\nimport scipy.stats as stats\n\n# T-test: compare means of mrm2 by treatment\ncontrol = df[df[\"treatment\"] == 0][\"mrm2\"]\ntreat = df[df[\"treatment\"] == 1][\"mrm2\"]\nt_stat, p_val = stats.ttest_ind(control, treat)\nprint(\"T-test result:\")\nprint(\"t-statistic:\", t_stat)\nprint(\"p-value:\", p_val)\n\n# Linear regression: mrm2 ~ treatment\nmodel = smf.ols(\"mrm2 ~ treatment\", data=df).fit()\nprint(\"\\nLinear regression result:\")\nprint(model.summary())\n\n## Charitable Contribution Made\n\n\nprint(\"Charitable Contribution Made\")\n# q1\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Calculate proportion of people who donated in each group\ndonation_rates = df.groupby(\"treatment\")[\"gave\"].mean()\ndonation_rates.index = [\"Control\", \"Treatment\"]\n\n# Plot\ndonation_rates.plot(kind=\"bar\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Proportion Donated\")\nplt.title(\"Donation Rate by Treatment Group\")\nplt.ylim(0, 0.04)\nplt.show()\n\n#q2\n\n# T-test\ncontrol = df[df[\"treatment\"] == 0][\"gave\"]\ntreat = df[df[\"treatment\"] == 1][\"gave\"]\nt_stat, p_val = stats.ttest_ind(treat, control)\nprint(\"T-test:\")\nprint(\"t-statistic:\", t_stat)\nprint(\"p-value:\", p_val)\n\n# Linear regression\nmodel = smf.ols(\"gave ~ treatment\", data=df).fit()\nprint(\"\\nLinear Regression:\")\nprint(model.summary())\n\n#q3\n\n# Probit model: gave ~ treatment\nprobit_model = smf.probit(\"gave ~ treatment\", data=df).fit()\nprint(probit_model.summary())\n\nmfx = probit_model.get_margeff()\nprint(mfx.summary())\n\nprint(\"Differences between Match Rates\")\n\ntreat_df = df[df[\"treatment\"] == 1]\n\n# Compare 2:1 vs 1:1\ngroup_1_1 = treat_df[treat_df[\"ratio\"] == 1][\"gave\"]\ngroup_2_1 = treat_df[treat_df[\"ratio2\"] == 1][\"gave\"]\nt_2, p_2 = stats.ttest_ind(group_2_1, group_1_1)\nprint(\"2:1 vs 1:1 match rate:\")\nprint(\"t-statistic:\", t_2, \"p-value:\", p_2)\n\n# Compare 3:1 vs 1:1\ngroup_3_1 = treat_df[treat_df[\"ratio3\"] == 1][\"gave\"]\nt_3, p_3 = stats.ttest_ind(group_3_1, group_1_1)\nprint(\"\\n3:1 vs 1:1 match rate:\")\nprint(\"t-statistic:\", t_3, \"p-value:\", p_3)\n\nprint(\"I tested whether increasing the match ratio from 1:1 to 2:1 or 3:1 significantly \\n increased donation rates.

The t-test directly compares means between treatment and control groups, while the regression coefficient on the treatment variable represents the difference in means between groups. As expected, both methods yield identical results for each variable. None of the variables show statistically significant differences between treatment and control groups at the 95% confidence level (all p-values &gt; 0.05). This confirms that the randomization was successful in creating balanced groups. Table 1 in the paper serves this exact purpose - to demonstrate that the randomization created comparable groups, allowing us to attribute any differences in outcomes to the treatment rather than pre-existing differences between groups."
