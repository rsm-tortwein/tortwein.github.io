The positive coefficients for both Netflix and Prime indicate a higher utility associated with these services compared to Hulu. Furthermore, the coefficient for Netflix is larger than that of Prime, suggesting that, all else equal, consumers have a stronger preference for Netflix. This result is consistent with real-world market dynamics, where Netflix has historically maintained a dominant position in the streaming industry.\n",

        "Price:\n",
        "The negative coefficient for price aligns with economic intuition as the monthly subscription price increases, consumer utility and the probability of choosing that option decrease. The magnitude of this coefficient quantifies how sensitive consumers are to price changes. For each one-dollar increase in price, utility decreases by β_price units. Understanding this tradeoff enables streaming services to optimize their pricing strategies by balancing potential revenue gains from higher prices against potential subscriber losses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Advertisement Impact:\n",
        "The coefficient for ads is also negative, indicating that consumers generally prefer ad-free experiences. The magnitude of this coefficient suggests that the presence of ads significantly reduces consumer utility, an effect comparable to that of a substantial price increase. This finding underscores the importance of ad-free options in maintaining consumer satisfaction and subscription rates.\n",

        "Instead of assuming that all consumers are the same, the simulation can be made more realistic by allowing each person to have their own unique preferences. Instead of using one set of preferences (like how much people dislike ads or how sensitive they are to price), the model gives each individual their own version of these preferences.\n",
        "\n",
        "These personal preferences would be based on general trends seen across all consumers, but with room for variation. This means some people might be more sensitive to price, others might care more about having no ads, and some might have a stronger preference for a particular streaming service.\n",
        "\n",
        "By doing this, the simulation can better reflect real-life behavior, where different people value things differently.\n"
